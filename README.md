# Introduction
This software is a viewer for browsing large quantities of images created with Stable Diffusion, as well as for displaying reference images when drawing illustrations. It is also created for use as a regular photo frame. We hope you find it useful.

# Overview
This software is a gadget for image viewing designed for Windows Sidebar. 
To use it, you need to install software that restores the old sidebar gadgets to work, such as <8GadgetPack>https://8gadgetpack.net/. 
Additionally, since the gadget has outdated specifications, it does not support image formats such as webp. (Supported image formats include BMP, GIF, JPEG, and PNG.)

# Installation
It can be installed by double-clicking like a regular gadget as long as the sidebar is running.

# Uninstallation
Right-click to open the gadget menu window and select "Uninstall" from the right-click menu of the icon.

# Usage
When you move the mouse to the center of the screen, buttons for playing/stopping the slideshow and switching to the previous/next image will appear. 
At the top of the screen, you can set the zoom level. Double-clicking on the screen will open the corresponding folder. 
Detailed settings can be accessed from the "Options" button displayed at the upper right corner of the gadget. 
Please specify the folder for the images you want to display from this options screen. Additionally, some functions can be operated using the keyboard. 
The left and right arrow keys switch to the previous/next image. The down arrow key plays/stops the slideshow. 
The up arrow key displays the current image in the default image viewer application.
